# Game Theory Project: Customs Import vs. Domestic Quality Improvement
In this project, we determine when the customs department decides to import cars and when to ban imports.

## Overview

This project delves into the realm of game theory, specifically focusing on a scenario where the Customs Department has to make a critical decision: whether to allow the import of cars or compel domestic manufacturers to enhance the quality of their products. Through a series of strategic choices, the game explores the dynamics between Customs and domestic car manufacturers.

## Problem Statement

In the context of this game:

- **Customs (Cu)** represents the Customs Department, responsible for regulating imports.
- **Car Manufacturer (P)** symbolizes the domestic car manufacturing industry.

The central question is whether the Customs Department should permit imports or push domestic car manufacturers to improve the quality of their products. These decisions can have profound economic and market implications.

## Methodology

The project employs game theory concepts to analyze and model this scenario. The primary factors under consideration include:

- **Quality Improvement**: A parameter representing the willingness of Customs to enforce quality improvement.
- **Importation**: The likelihood that Customs will allow imports.
- **Quality Enhancement**: The probability that the car manufacturers will opt for quality improvement.

## Game Analysis

1. **Pure Nash Equilibria**: The project first identifies pure Nash equilibria where both Customs and the car manufacturers make straightforward decisions. These pure equilibria form the foundation of the game analysis.

2. **Mixed Nash Equilibria**: The project explores mixed Nash equilibria, where strategies are mixed probabilistically. It examines scenarios where Customs may choose to import with a certain probability while domestic manufacturers may decide to enhance quality with a different probability.

3. **Optimal Decision Boundaries**: The analysis establishes optimal decision boundaries that guide Customs and car manufacturers to make the most strategic choices. These boundaries are defined by parameters such as C1, D11, D12, D21, and D22, which represent key thresholds for decisions.

## Results

The game analysis reveals crucial insights into the decision-making dynamics between Customs and domestic car manufacturers. It identifies scenarios where pure and mixed Nash equilibria occur and provides a deeper understanding of the trade-off between importation and quality enhancement.

The results can inform real-world policy decisions and help anticipate the outcomes of different strategies employed by Customs and domestic car manufacturers.
